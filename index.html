                        physical combat abilities, Finn also practiced as a wizard. Finn's hobbies are making music,
                        adventuring, and playing video games. His main character traits are bravery, selflessness,
                        integrity, creativity, and kindness.

                    <h2>The Ice King</h2>
                    <p>Ice King, formerly known as Simon Petrikov, is a villainous king with an incredibly tragic
                        backstory. Ice Kings spends his days capturing princesses fromm various kingdoms in an attempt
                        to
                        gain their hand in marriage. It was later revealed that Simon had lost his fianc√©e during a war
                        and had called her "Princess." In his human life, he was a kind and selfless antiquarian. Simon
                        had discovered a jeweled crown
                        that caused him to have visions when placed atop his head. This crown's power eventually
                        overtook his natural form and transformed him into a blue, bearded, and violent wizard.
